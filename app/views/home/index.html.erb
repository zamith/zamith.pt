      <h1>Luís Ferreira</h1>
      <p>
        Born and raised in Guimarães, I went to Braga to get my college degree in Informatics and have not yet left.
      </p>
      <p>
        A geek at heart. Got in touch with Web development while finishing my graduation and since then, have never stopped loving it and am constantly trying to learn more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, I met a group of people who shared the same passion for building reliable and beautiful products, and with whom I work at <%= link_to "Group Buddies", "http://groupbuddies.com" %>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from Web development, another great passion of mine are sports. I play basketball almost daily and go skiing whenever possible.
